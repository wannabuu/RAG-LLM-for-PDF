# RAG-LLM-for-PDF

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and analyze PDF documents. It combines the power of LLMs with efficient document retrieval to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text and metadata from PDF files.
- **Document Indexing**: Creates embeddings for efficient document retrieval.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval and generation for context-aware responses.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages state-of-the-art language models for natural language understanding.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different use cases and datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-LLM-for-PDF.git
    cd RAG-LLM-for-PDF
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables (if required).
